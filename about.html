          <p> As you probably noticed, my name is Karina <i class="em em-grinning"></i>. 
                  I am born in October 2000. I used to compete in Taekwon-Do (I was quite good actually), but now I just train for fun. 
                  Probably the most important thing about me is that I'm a total tech geek. Not the Sheldon Cooper type of person though. I'm more
                  something between Penny and Leonard. 
                  I love skateboarding, running, kicking, watching series <i class="em em-tv"></i>, coding, listening and writing music, playng the guitar,
                  designing, partying, having deep talks and most of all - winning. <i class="em em-trophy"></i> <br>
                  <i class="em em-muscle"></i> If we've met, you probably already know this because I talk waaaay too much. But if we haven't,
                  feel free to write to me for anything and if you don't want to - just know 
                  that I'm thankful that you've found this blog.
