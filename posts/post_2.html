<p>
	Yeah, I’m that friend. You’ll usually hear me talking about what gym clothes I bought,
          what marathon I just payed for or who I fought with in my last sparring session. 
	I train a lot and know I will tell you why you should too. <br> </p> <p>
	Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away I used to compete in Taekwon-Do. 
        It was a great experience, you know casually getting medals and being the best of the best. 
        But that is not why I think you should train. It’s about what training gives you. <br> </p> <p>
	First of all, biologically talking, training maintains your immune system and makes it stronger
        which maybe doesn’t sound like something big but is indeed huge. By having a strong immune system,
        your body doesn’t suffer so often from viruses, your allergies lessen and the stress levels are quite smaller. 
        Also your sleep better and your mood improves dramatically. 
        You get fitter and more attractive because come on let’s spill the truth
        – you’ll always prefer someone who looks healthy rather than someone who east junk food 24/7. <br> </p> <p>
	For me personally training is not about looks, it’s more about the mentality that you acquire from all these hours of training. 
	  The thing that sparked my love for sport was Taekwon-Do – a martial art that’s mostly all about kicking. 
	  By the way, today (11th April) is the birthday of Taekwon-Do as a martial art. The first and probably thing my instructors
	  taught me were the principles of Taekwon-Do – Courtesy, Integrity, Preservance, Self-control and most of all Indomitable Spirit. <br> </p> <p>
	  You are probably asking yourself what is this shit right now and why would knowing this make you start training. 
	  However, truth is, it isn’t shit, it is something everyone should be taught even in school. By living according to these principles,
	  you are not only a better person –  you make those around you even better. Let’s take self-control for example. 
	  What would you do if someone hits you? You probably would hit back. A martial artist won’t do that – he will avoid the blow 
	  and won’t hit back. If a martial artist’s friend were in a middle of a fight, the fighter would do anything in his hands
	  to protect everyone – not just his friend, but also the aggressor(s). 
	  <br> </p> <p>There is something else about mentality too – have you seen someone lifting very heavy weights?
        You probably have. Just by looking at their face you see all the determination and willpower they use to lift up that weight
        – just as if they were lifting the world. Every weightlifter I’ve talked with always says something – for them lifting
        (squatting for example) is just like life – when life starts getting heavy and pushes you down, you should try to get up,
        to lift all the worries and problems.
		<br> </p> <p>If you should get on thing from that short post it is that <b> you should train </b> because it makes you a better person – healthier both mentally and physically.
          </p>
